_de_params = """pop_size (int, optional): Population size. Defaults to 100.
    sampling (Sampling, optional): Sampling strategy of pymoo. Defaults to LHS().
    variant (str, optional): Differential evolution strategy. Must be a string in the format:
        "DE/selection/n/crossover", in which, n in an integer of number of difference vectors, and crossover is either "bin" or "exp".
        Selection variants are:
            - "ranked"
            - "rand"
            - "best"
            - "current-to-best"
            - "current-to-best"
            - "current-to-rand"
            - "rand-to-best"
        The selection strategy "ranked" might be helpful to improve convergence speed without much harm to diversity.
        Defaults to "DE/rand/1/bin"
    CR (float, optional): Crossover parameter. Defined in the range [0, 1]
        To reinforce mutation, use higher values. To control convergence speed, use lower values.
    F (iterable of float or float, optional): Scale factor or mutation parameter. Defined in the range (0, 2]
        To reinforce exploration, use higher lower bounds; for exploitation, use lower values.
    gamma (float, optional): Jitter deviation parameter. Should be in the range (0, 2). Defaults to 1e-4.
    SA (float, optional): Probability of using self-adaptive scale factor. Defaults to None.
    pm (Mutation, optional): Pymoo's mutation operators after crossover. Defaults to NoMutation().
    reapair (Repair, optional): Repair of mutant vectors. Is either callable or one of:
        "bounce-back"
        "midway"
        "rand-init"
        "to-bounds"
        If callable, has the form fun(X, Xb, xl, xu) in which X contains mutated vectors including violations, Xb contains reference vectors for repair in feasible space, xl is a 1d vector of lower bounds, and xu a 1d vector of upper bounds.
        Defaults to "bounce-back".
    survival (Survival, optional): Pymoo's survival strategy.
        Defaults to RankSurvival() with bulk removal ("full") and crowding distances ("cd").
        In GDE3, the survival strategy is applied after a one-to-one comparison between child vector and corresponding parent when both are non-dominated by the other.
