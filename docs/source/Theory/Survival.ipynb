In this one-to-one comparison, one of the individuals of each pair might be removed in advance from the combined population before (µ+λ) survival if dominated by the other."

GDE3-MNN is a variant of GDE3 proposed by Kukkonen and Deb <cite data-cite=\"gde3many\"></cite> that replaces original crowding distances of Rank and Crowding survival with an M-Nearest Neighbors based crowding metric with recursive elimination and re-calculation. It has improved a lot the performance of GDE3 in many-objective problems."
